Today I am visiting a biergarten in Berlin.
I am eating a brot with my drink from the biergarten
Then, after eating, I went shopping and got a Dirndel and Lederhose
At the shop, I saw a hund sleeping next to the klimaanlage- it was a hot day!
Since it was so hot, I decided to buy a car to get A/C, so I went to some BMW and Porsche dealerships.
